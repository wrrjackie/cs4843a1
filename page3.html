        <p>Hosting a static website on S3 and accessing the cached website pages using <br>
            CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. CloudFront offers low latency <br>
            and high transfer speeds during website rendering. Note that Static website hosting <br>    
            essentially requires a public bucket, whereas the CloudFront can work with public <br>
            and private buckets.</p>
